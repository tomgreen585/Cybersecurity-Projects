Implementation can be found here (STILL IN PROGRESS): <https://github.com/tomgreen585/PrivML-FHE>

## What It Does

Project involves implementating a privacy-preserving machine learning model using Fully Homomorphic Encryption.

## Purpose

With growing concerns around data privacy and collecting sensitive information, the ability to process data securely without exposing its underlying form has become a key engineering challenge. As machine learning (ML) models become increasingly integrated into business sectors, their reliance on raw data raises significant privacy and security risks.

This project proposes developing a privacy-preserving ML system using Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), a cryptographic method that enables computations to be performed directly on encrypted data. The aim is to investigate whether an end-to-end solution, where a selected ML model is trained and used for inference without decrypting input data, is feasible and practical under current constraints.

THe project will be evaluated by comparing the performance and accuracy of the encrypted model with an equivalent unencrypted version. Exploration into real-world use of FHE will be performed once requirements have been met, with a demonstration with a simple UI to show how this technology could be applied in practice.
