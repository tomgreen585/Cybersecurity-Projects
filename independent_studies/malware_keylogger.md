# Malware Keylogger

Implementation can be found here: <https://github.com/tomgreen585/MalwareKeylogger>

## What It Does

Proof-of-concept malware that showcases the ability to adopt an attackers mindset.

Has Command and Control Architecture: where the C2 is sending commands to the registered malware instance, receiving exfiltrated data, and receiving beacon signals to monitor active malware sessions. Also has commands putting the 'registed' malware to sleep, shut down, and displays a window message on the registed malware saying it has 'pwned' their machine.

The malware logs all keystrokes for non-/printable keys, where it periodically uploads the 'logfile' sending it to the C2 server, deletes the locally saved keylog file on a interval, and confirms the data is successfully being sent to the C2 and retries 3 times.

Malware also performs on-disk encoding when keylog data is written to file. The malware and C2 perform network encoding for all communications, including commands and exfiltrated data.

Malware also beacons to the C2 to indicate active status every 30 seconds, performs polling to the C2 server to fetch any new commands to execute and the beacon includes the malware id and timestamp for logging/tracking.

Also has a C2_Helper which performs GET requests to receive a list of the registered malware instances with their corresponding, unique id, last beacon timestamp, link to the collected logs. Also performs a GET request to receive keystrokes collected from a specific malware instance, performs a POST request to send a command to the malware instance (e.g. shd, pwn). The malware also runs silently in the background, with no open terminal.

Also cannot be traced or run by debuggers for malware analysis, cannot run in a sandbox, cannot be analysed through network traffic, analysed in a Virtual Machine (e.g. VirtualBox), cannot be analysed in a disassembler. It is also rebootable on the 'attacked' machine through registry persistence, has a spoofed signature signed by a CN, and is not deemed malicious by Virus Total.
