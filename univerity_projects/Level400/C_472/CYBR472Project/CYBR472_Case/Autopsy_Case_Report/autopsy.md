# Autopsy Case Report

Had issues with my autopsy report registering my keyword search outputs. This was the main issue I was having during analysis.

- Issue was I set my Virtual Machine memory to 4GB which resulted in it struggling to get through the 300,000+ files.
- Resolved this and was able to return a keyword search for my list 'another' as seen in keyword_created_list_1.png and keyword_created_list_2.png.
- Can see the results from the keyword search returning in keyword_list_hits.png.
