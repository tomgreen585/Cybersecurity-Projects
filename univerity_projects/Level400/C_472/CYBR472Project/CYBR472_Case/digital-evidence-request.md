## Facts to be Investigated

Primary Offence: Importation of Class A Controlled Drug (Methamphetamine)

### Description of Investigation

Due to intelligence provided by the Australian government, the suspects Jane Esteban and John Fredricksen were intercepted by Customs upon arriving in Wellington, New Zealand from Brisbane. The suspects were searched by a customs officer. John Fredricksen's baggage consisted of clothing, toiletries and a Windows laptop. Jane Esteban's baggage also consisted of clothing, toiletries and a small Windows laptop. Upon further investigation of the lining of John Fredricksen's suitcase, one kilogram of Methamphetamine was discovered. Both suspects were taken into separate interview rooms where they were interrogated. John Fredricksen refused to answer any questions. Jane Esteban stated all she knew and that she had to deliver the suitcase to the "Eastbourne library" but if all else failed then they were to deliver it to 666 Rewera Avenue, Petone as told by John Fredricksen. Customs and police subsequently raided that address. There was nobody present at the address. Customs did, however, find drugs, guns and a desktop computer in the living room of the suspect's house.

You are a Customs forensics investigator. Your task is to examine the forensic image and memory dump of the suspect's desktop computer to determine the relationship between John Fredrickson and the suspect, their future intentions and any other supporting evidence that pertains to the case.
